#
#   1) Keychain profile (easiest locally). The password is an app-specific
#      password from appleid.apple.com → Sign-In & Security → App-Specific
#      Passwords, NOT your Apple ID password:
#
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "Amped" \
#          --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id 82K3YC8HVF --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
#
#      Then set NOTARY_PROFILE=Amped in .env.
#
#   2) App Store Connect API key (headless / CI). Create a key at
#      appstoreconnect.apple.com → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store
#      Connect API, then set in .env (or the CI env):
#
#        NOTARY_KEY=/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
#        NOTARY_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX        # the key's Key ID
#        NOTARY_ISSUER=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-... # the Issuer ID shown above the keys
